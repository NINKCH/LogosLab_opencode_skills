# Technical Decisions
<!-- 
  WHAT: Record of all technical and design decisions with rationale
  WHY: You'll forget why you made choices - this preserves that knowledge
  WHEN: Update immediately after making any significant decision
-->

## Decisions Log
<!-- 
  WHAT: Chronological log of all decisions
  WHY: Provides history and context for future reference
  EXAMPLE:
    | Use Express + TypeScript | Mature, type-safe, large ecosystem | 2024-01-19 |
    | PostgreSQL over MongoDB | Need ACID transactions, relational data | 2024-01-19 |
-->
| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
|          |           |      |

## Architecture Choices
<!-- 
  WHAT: High-level architectural decisions
  WHY: Documents system structure and design philosophy
  EXAMPLE:
    - **Monolithic vs Microservices**: Monolithic - simpler deployment, team size
    - **REST vs GraphQL**: REST - simpler, well-understood, sufficient for use case
-->
- **Choice**: Reason for this architectural decision

## Technology Stack
<!-- 
  WHAT: Selected technologies and tools
  WHY: Quick reference for what's being used
  WHEN: Update as stack is finalized
-->
- **Technology**: Why this was chosen over alternatives

## Trade-offs Made
<!-- 
  WHAT: Options considered and why one was chosen over another
  WHY: Shows thoughtful decision-making process
  EXAMPLE:
    | JWT auth | Session auth | JWT | Stateless, scales better, mobile-friendly |
-->
| Option A | Option B | Chosen | Why |
|----------|----------|--------|-----|
|          |          |        |     |

## Design Patterns Used
<!-- 
  WHAT: Design patterns applied in the solution
  WHEN: Document as you implement patterns
-->
- **Pattern Name**: Where and why it's applied

## Rejected Approaches
<!-- 
  WHAT: Approaches considered but not chosen
  WHY: Prevents revisiting already-rejected ideas
  WHEN: Document when rejecting an approach
-->
| Approach | Reason for Rejection |
|----------|---------------------|
|          |                     |

## Future Considerations
<!-- 
  WHAT: Things to revisit or improve later
  WHY: Captures ideas for future iterations
-->
- [Something to revisit or improve later]

**Last Updated**: [timestamp]

<!-- 
  REMINDER:
  - Document decisions immediately - don't wait
  - Include rationale - "why" is more important than "what"
  - Update when decisions change
