# Research & Discoveries
<!-- 
  WHAT: Your knowledge base for discoveries and research
  WHY: Multimodal content (images, browser) doesn't persist - must be captured as text
  WHEN: After EVERY 2 view/browser/search operations (2-Action Rule)
-->

## Recent Discoveries
<!-- 
  CRITICAL: Update after every 2 view/browser/search operations
  WHY: Visual/multimodal information gets lost when context resets
-->

| Finding | Source | Date | Relevance |
|---------|--------|------|-----------|
|         |        |      |           |

## Important URLs
<!-- 
  WHAT: Keep URLs even if content is dropped from context
  WHY: Preserves pointer to full data for later reference
-->
- 

## Code Patterns Discovered
<!-- 
  WHAT: Useful patterns, libraries, or approaches found during research
  WHEN: After exploring codebases or documentation
-->
```
// Pattern discovered
```

## API/Library Notes
<!-- 
  WHAT: Key information about APIs or libraries being used
  WHEN: After reading documentation or testing APIs
-->
- 

## Visual/Browser Findings
<!-- 
  CRITICAL: MUST capture visual information as text immediately
  WHY: Screenshots and browser content don't persist in context
  EXAMPLE:
    - Screenshot shows login form has email and password fields
    - Browser shows API returns JSON with "status" and "data" keys
-->
<!-- Update IMMEDIATELY after viewing images or browser results -->
